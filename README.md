# FineOffsetNET
FineOffset communication NET code.

## Background
The code is a compilation of shared and own code put together to establish communication through USB to a 
FineOffset weather station (WH1080) in a a.NET environment. 

## Aknowledgement
Thanks to creators of LibUsbDotNet for providing a stable library for USB communication.
Thanks go to Rainer Finkeldeh for the WMR-2000 code that pushed me into the right direction when wrapping the brain
around the USB communication with the weather stations and doing the detective work for establishing the communication
protocol.
Thanks also go to Michael Pendec, Arne Jorgen Auberg, Jim Easterbrook and a few others (I will get the names later)
who were so kind and posted their findings during their work with the station.
